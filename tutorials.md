# Tutorials
We've created a host of code-focused tutorials that will help you get
started with *TimescaleDB*.

For most of these tutorials, you will also need a working instance of *TimescaleDB*. The fastest way
to get started with *TimescaleDB* is [setting up *Timescale Cloud*][timescale-cloud-install].
*Timescale Cloud* is a hosted version of *TimescaleDB*. If you prefer,
you can download the [TimescaleDB Community Edition][timescale-community-install]
and run it on your desktop or your own cloud infrastructure.
