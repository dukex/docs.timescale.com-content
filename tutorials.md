# Tutorials
We've created a host of code-focused tutorials that will help you get
started with *TimescaleDB*.

For most of these tutorials, you will also need a working instance of *TimescaleDB*. The fastest way
to get started with *TimescaleDB* is [setting up *Timescale Cloud*][timescale-cloud-install].
*Timescale Cloud* is a hosted version of *TimescaleDB*. If you prefer,
you can download the [TimescaleDB Community Edition][timescale-community-install]
and run it on your desktop or your own cloud infrastructure.

### Common scenarios for using TimescaleDB

- **[Start Here - Hello Timescale][Hello Timescale]**: If you are new to TimescaleDB
or even SQL, check out our tutorial with NYC taxicab data to get an idea of the
capabilities our database has to offer.
- **[Time-series Forecasting][Forecasting]**: Use R, Apache MADlib and Python to perform
data analysis and make forecasts on your data.

### How to use specific TimescaleDB features

- **[Continuous Aggregates][]**: Getting started with continuous aggregates.

### Integrating with other products

- **[Prometheus adapter][]**: Integrate TimescaleDB with Prometheus monitoring for scalability and SQL powers
- **[Collecting metrics with Telegraf][Telegraf Output Plugin]**: Collecting metrics with the PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB output plugin for Telegraf
- **[Migrate from InfluxDB with Outflux][Outflux]**: Use our open-source migration tool to transfer your data from InfluxDB to TimescaleDB.

### Additional resources

- **[Sample data sets][Data Sets]**: And if you want to explore on your own
with some sample data, we have some ready-made data sets for you to explore.
- **[psql installation][psql]**: Learn how to install psql on Mac, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows, and pick up some valuable `psql` tips and tricks along the way.
